# Wiener Filter for Speech Enhancement

Implementation of a short-time spectral Wiener filter for noise reduction in speech signals.

This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and evaluation of a classical statistical speech enhancement algorithm under both stationary and non-stationary noise conditions.

## Overview

Speech recordings in real-world environments are often degraded by background noise. This project implements a Wiener filter-based enhancement pipeline to estimate clean speech from noisy observations.

The system operates in the short-time frequency domain and adapts the suppression gain per time-frequency bin based on estimated speech and noise statistics.

Performance is evaluated using objective SNR improvement across multiple input noise levels.

Key Features:

* Short-time spectral Wiener filtering
* Noise power spectral density (PSD) estimation from real signals
* Frame-wise adaptive suppression
* Evaluation under stationary and non-stationary noise
* Objective performance analysis using SNR metrics

## Algorithm Summary

The enhancement pipeline consists of the following stages:

### 1. Preprocessing

* Clean speech and noise signals are loaded and resampled.
* Noise is scaled to achieve controlled input SNR levels (-5, 0, 5, 10 dB).
* Noisy speech is generated by additive mixing.

### 2. Short-Time Spectral Analysis

* Signal is segmented into overlapping frames.
* Hamming window applied to each frame.
* FFT computed to obtain time-frequency representation.

### 3. Noise PSD Estimation

* Noise power spectrum estimated from an initial noise-only segment.
* Assumed stationary within short analysis windows.

### 4. Speech PSD Approximation

* Speech power estimated from noisy spectrum minus noise spectrum.
* Negative values clipped for numerical stability.

### 5. Wiener Gain Computation

* Gain calculated per time-frequency bin based on relative speech and noise energy.
* Gain values range between 0 (strong suppression) and 1 (preservation).

### 6. Reconstruction

* Enhanced spectrum obtained by applying Wiener gain.
* Inverse FFT performed per frame.
* Overlap-add synthesis reconstructs time-domain signal.

## Experimental Setup

* Window length: 1024 samples
* 50% overlap
* FFT length: 2048
* Noise estimation from first 0.25 s
* Suppression control parameter tuned empirically

Two noise types were evaluated - Stationary speech-shaped noise and Non-stationary babble noise.

## Results

### Output SNR (dB)

| Input SNR | Stationary Noise | Babble Noise |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| -5 dB     | 3.84             | 1.63         |
| 0 dB      | 7.71             | 6.07         |
| 5 dB      | 11.60            | 10.36        |
| 10 dB     | 15.49            | 14.56        |

* Consistent SNR improvement across all conditions
* Stronger enhancement under stationary noise
* Reduced performance for rapidly varying babble noise
* Performance aligns with Wiener filter stationarity assumptions
